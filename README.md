[`FastGit`](https://doc.fastgit.org/) works as a mirror of `GitHub` to
make significant accelerations.

`fgitR` is a package to do git operation with `FastGit` automatically.

## Installation

`figtR` has been released in
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fgitR). You can install the
released version of fgitR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("fgitR")

# Compiling from Source
remotes::install_github("FastGitORG/fgitR")

# For upgrade installed `fgitR`
fgitR::fgit_install("FastGitORG/fgitR")
```

## Install package from Source

``` r
library(fgitR)
#> 
#>     fgitR is created by Han Chen and maintained by FastGit UK Team who creates fastgit.org.
#> 

# fgitR can install package by Repository's Name
# fgitR_install("https://github.com/r-lib/diffviewer")

# fgitR can install package by Repository's URL

## List all branch from Remote

``` r
branch_ls <-
  fgit_branch("FastGitORG/fgitR")

branch_ls
#> [1] "HEAD"                "refs/heads/gh-pages" "refs/heads/git2r"   
#> [4] "refs/heads/main"
```

### Reinventing the wheel?

For the initially consideration, we believe it is necessary to add
following functions:

-   Commit
-   Pull
-   Push

Due to `git` is not only clone to local, but also contribute back. But
in the `git clone` or `fgit clone` procedure, the remote will be set as
`fastgit.org` or other mirror domain. Hence, there is nothing special to
make further operations.
